        -   Description: this is the default login page that APEX generates when a new application is created that requires authentication. No custom coding/customization has been applied to this page.
-   Data Management Pages
    -   (Page ID: 210) Cruise List
        -   Interactive report that shows all research cruises with some aggregate information like start/end dates, days at sea, and associated cruise legs
        -   Authorized users can create a new cruise by clicking the Create button which will forward them to the View/Edit Cruise page with no cruise selected.
        -   Authorized users can view or edit a given cruise by clicking the Edit icon on a given cruise's table row which will forward them to the View/Edit Cruise page with the corresponding cruise selected.
        -   Authorized users can copy the values from an existing cruise by clicking the Copy icon on a given cruise's table row will forward them to the View/Edit Cruise page with the corresponding cruise's values in the form so they can be modified appropriately and saved. This functionality was intended to streamline data entry by allowing a similar existing cruise's values to be copied and modified instead of defining each value manually.
            -   **Note: the new cruise record is not saved until the "Create" or "Create Another" button is clicked and successfully processed.
        -   Standard interactive report tooltips are available for all columns included in the report
    -   (Page ID: 220) View/Edit Cruise
        -   Certain drop down fields (e.g. Standard Survey Name) have a corresponding "Filter List" checkbox to filter the values available; checking the box will update the select field to filter out all reference table options that are not marked as "Visible in App" and unchecking the box will display all options in the database
        -   The page accepts one parameter, a Cruise ID. If no Cruise ID is specified (click the Create button on Cruise List page) an authorized user is allowed to create a new cruise record. The data form will allow the new cruise information to be specified
            -   If the "Copy" icon was clicked on the Cruise List page the values from the corresponding Cruise will be used to populate the data form as well as the attribute forms so they can be modified by the user and saved.
                -   *Note: the Target Species - Other Species tab is populated with the other species associated with the copied Cruise. APEX does not expose unselected tab contents on the page load event so JavaScript was developed to select the other species tab and then make an Ajax request for the other species associated with the copied Cruise and uses the JavaScript API to add the rows and specify their values. The original tab is then selected again to restore the original functionality
            -   Clicking on the "Create" button will save the record and reload the page with the new cruise selected allowing the user to create records (e.g. cruise legs, target species, etc.) associated with the new cruise
            -   Clicking on the "Create Another" button will save the record and reload the page with no cruise selected to allow the user to create another cruise record.
        -   If a Cruise ID is specified (click the Edit icon on Cruise List page) an authorized user can edit the selected cruise record and all associated records.
            -   Clicking on the "Delete" button will prompt the user to confirm if they want to delete the selected cruise record. Clicking the "OK" button will attempt to delete the record but it will fail unless there are no records that reference the specified Cruise record, if it is successful the user is forwarded to the Cruise List page. Clicking the "Cancel" button will cancel the delete action.
            -   Clicking on the "Apply Changes" button will attempt to save the record and reload the page.
            -   Clicking on the "Deep Copy" button will attempt to copy the selected Cruise and all of the associated Legs as well, unsaved changes made on the Cruise data form will not be included in the copied Cruise. Following successful processing the user will be redirected to the View/Edit Cruise page for the copied Cruise so it can be modified accordingly
        -   Cruise Attributes Region Tabs:
            -   When the mouse pointer hovers over any of the Region Tabs the associated tooltip will be displayed
            -   Cruise Summary:
                -   **Note: this region is only visible if the Edit icon was clicked on the Cruise List page or if the record was just created using the "Create" button
                -   This read-only region shows aggregate information for the given cruise
            -   Cruise Legs:
                -   **Note: this region is only visible if the Edit icon was clicked on the Cruise List page or if the record was just created using the "Create" button
                -   The user can create a new cruise leg associated with the selected Cruise record by clicking the "Create" button on the Cruise Legs section
                -   The user can view or edit a given cruise leg by clicking the Edit icon on a given cruise leg's table row which will forward them to the View/Edit Cruise Leg page with the corresponding cruise leg selected
                -   Authorized users can copy the values from an existing cruise leg by clicking the Copy icon on a given leg's table row will forward them to the View/Edit Cruise Leg page with the corresponding cruise leg's values in the form so they can be modified appropriately and saved. This functionality was intended to streamline data entry by allowing a similar existing cruise leg's values to be copied and modified instead of defining each value manually.
                    -   **Note: the new cruise leg record is not saved until the "Create" or "Create Another" button is clicked and successfully processed.
            -   QC Validation Issues:
                -   **Note: this region is only visible if the Edit icon was clicked on the Cruise List page or if the record was just created using the "Create" button
                -   This region contains an interactive grid report that displays all QC validation issues identified by the DVM that are associated with the given Cruise so they can be reviewed and/or annotated.
                    -   [DVM Issue Policies](#dvm-issue-policies)
                -   Clicking on the "Apply Changes" button will attempt to save the associated records.
            -   Shuttle Fields and Preset Options:
                -   This setup is implemented for all many-to-many cruise table relationships with the following reference tables:
                    -   Primary Survey Category, Secondary Survey Category, Target Species - ESA, Target Species - MMPA, Target Species - FSSI, Expected Species Categories
                -   A shuttle field is available showing all of the options for a given reference table (e.g. Expected Species Categories). Users select records to associate with the given cruise by moving options to the right side of the field.
                -   Preset Region:
                    -   The preset region contains a select field that lists all defined presets for the given reference table.
                    -   A classic report containing the reference table options defined for the given preset is displayed below the select field.
                    -   Changing the select field value will reload the report with the corresponding reference table options defined for the chosen preset
                    -   Clicking the Select Preset button will update the shuttle field to select the options defined for the chosen preset
                -   Filtering:
                    -   Certain shuttle fields have a corresponding "Filter List?" checkbox field. Checking the box will update the shuttle field to filter out all reference table options that are not marked as "Visible in App" and unchecking the box will display all options in the database
                        -   When the "Filter List?" checkbox has its value changed the APEX app sends an Ajax request to the server for the updated list of options for the shuttle field based on the selected Cruise (for editing or copying a cruise), selected shuttle options, and "Filter List?" checkbox values.  The values returned by the server will be used to refresh the shuttle field and the selected options before the Ajax request will be preserved.
                -   Clicking on the "Create", "Create Another", or "Apply Changes" button will also attempt to save the associated records.
            -   Target Species - Other Species
                -   This tabular form can be used to associate new target other species or edit associated target other species for the selected cruise
                -   Clicking on the "Create", "Create Another", or "Apply Changes" button will also attempt to save the associated records.
        -   Data Validation:

    -   (Page ID: 230) View/Edit Cruise Leg
        -   Certain drop down fields (e.g. Vessel) have a corresponding "Filter List" checkbox to filter the values available; checking the box will update the select field to filter out all reference table options that are not marked as "Visible in App" and unchecking the box will display all options in the database
        -   This page accepts two parameters; a Cruise ID and a Cruise Leg ID. If both parameters are blank the page displays an error message.
        -   When a Cruise ID is specified the page will display all Cruise information and specific associated record values (e.g. cruise start/end dates, number of associated legs, fiscal year, URL, etc.) for the specified Cruise.
            -   The Cruise Legs section of the page will display all associated Cruise Legs for the specified Cruise.
                -   Clicking the Edit icon next to a given Cruise Leg will reload the page with the given Cruise Leg specified.
                -   Clicking the Copy icon next to a given Cruise Leg will reload the page with the corresponding cruise leg's values in the form so they can be modified appropriately and saved. This functionality was intended to streamline data entry by allowing a similar existing cruise leg's values to be copied and modified instead of defining each value manually.
                    -   **Note: the new cruise leg record is not saved until the "Create" or "Create Another" button is clicked and successfully processed.

## Application Security:
-   [Standard APEX Security Documentation](security/APEX%20Security%20Documentation.md)
    -   This project utilizes the security documentation from version 0.5 (Git tag: APX_sec_v0.5) of the [APEX security project](https://picgitlab.nmfs.local/centralized-data-tools/apex_tools/-/blob/master/Security/APEX%20Security%20Documentation.md)
    -   \*\*Note: The [Application Pages](#application-pages) section outlines any exceptions to the standard APEX Application Security Controls
-   Authentication and Authorization Policy is implemented using the Authorization Application Module and is referenced in the [Cruise Database Documentation](../../docs/Centralized%20Cruise%20Database%20-%20Technical%20Documentation.md)
-   [Principle of least privilege](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qW2pDHM8bebmNJ76AfC-SgICKQPGmKSiUkXbrZ7OVQ/edit?usp=sharing): All of the data tables and support objects are defined in the CCD data schema (CEN_CRUISE), the APEX application's parsing schema (shadow schema) which is used to actually interact with the underlying database is CEN_CRUISE_APP. CEN_CRUISE_APP has very limited permissions on the CEN_CRUISE schema based on the required functionality of the application (see [CEN_CRUISE_APP_permissions.xlsx](CEN_CRUISE_APP_permissions.xlsx)) to implement the principle of least privilege.
