# Cruise Data Management Application Testing Documentation

## Overview:
The Cruise Data Management Application (CRDMA) has a series of tests on each of the application pages to confirm that they all function as expected before deploying the application for formal testing/production use. These test cases are intended to be executed in addition to module test cases provided in the [Resources](#resources) section.
