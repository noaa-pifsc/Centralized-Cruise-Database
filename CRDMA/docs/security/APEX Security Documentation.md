# APEX Security Documentation

## Overview:
This documentation project was created to provide standard security documentation to address specific security controls for [Information Input Validation](./APEX%20Security%20Documentation%20-%20Information%20Input%20Validation.md) (SI-10) and [Error Handling](./APEX%20Security%20Documentation%20-%20Error%20Handling.md) (SI-11) to streamline the process of deploying an application to production servers. The [Information Input Validation](./APEX%20Security%20Documentation%20-%20Information%20Input%20Validation.md) and [Error Handling](./APEX%20Security%20Documentation%20-%20Error%20Handling.md) documents should be adhered to and provided to ITS to clearly document the way the security controls have been addressed in a given application when submitting a System Change Request to deploy the application to production ([example JIRA ticket](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/jira/browse/PICITS-179071)).
