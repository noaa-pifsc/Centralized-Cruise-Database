# Centralized Cruise Database

## Overview:
The Centralized Cruise Database (CCD) is used to track information about each PIFSC research cruise including activities, regions, etc. to remove the need for each division/program to manage this information. This centralized database is available for all PIFSC database users to reference with their various division data sets.
