# Mission Plan App Overview

## Overview:
An APEX mission plan application was developed using data exported from a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OKb3_Wa-sat3QFoA_b9IHdEXgDyVe5Sw_VzVzBndS38/edit?usp=sharing). The data was exported and ingested into a database. The application uses the Google Earth/Maps API to visualize the different locations of operations at a given point in time to replace the manual analog method.
