	Include scripts/functions for integrating directly with cruise data in addition to the existing cruise legs


X document business rules for the delete, update, insert actions (automatic overlap checks)

DVM configuration:
	_ update the description template to remove the cruise dates as these will change as associated cruise legs are modified

X CCD_DVM_PKG procedure for deleting DVM records (implement in CRDMA in "Delete DVM Recs" Process)
	X CCD_DVM_PKG procedure to query for all overlapping cruises before deletion and then batch DVM execution on all overlapping records after the record is deleted

X update the procedure definitions for CCD_DVM_PKG and CCD_CRUISE_PKG

X cruise leg delete bug in the APEX app (did not have the TO_NUMBER() data type conversion for the overloaded procedure definition)

_ document the business rules for the reference tables and presets/preset options

X CRDMA test cases for the CCD_CRUISE_PKG and CCD_DVM_PKG

_ QC view for orphaned DVM_PTA_ISSUES records (not associated with a CCD_CRUISES record)


X package documentation updates (compile and reference the applicable business rules):

	X CCD DVM Documentation.md X
	X CCDP Documentation.md X
	X CRDMA CCDP Testing Documentation.md (finish up the SOP portion) X
	X CRDMA DVM Testing Documentation.md (work on test cases and SOP, etc.) X
	X CCDP Testing Documentation.md (X update to indicate which sheets are used in which test cases and rename the sheets) X
	X Centralized Cruise Database DVM Testing Documentation.md X

	X Cruise Data Management Application - End User Documentation.md X
	X Cruise Data Management Application - Testing Documentation.md X

_ **Maybe some of the stuff in DVM category 1 can be integrated into the CRDMA validation and then in QA testing
	_ probably only the cruise name - fiscal year validation is feasible
	_ high cruise DAS/length is probably not feasible from the view/edit cruise leg page


X ** ensure all testing SOPs make it clear that this is not intended for production use -> only on dev and test where the data loss is not a problem



X bug with redirect warning on deep copy:
	X look to see if we can use apex.navigation to resolve the issue -> it only occurs when there has been interaction with the form even if it's only to navigate using the tabbed container

future plans:
	_ CRDMA - another view to help schedule ship time (be able to see some type of Google Calendar type of view to show overlaps of vessel legs/cruise legs).  Maybe allow the cruise leg dates to be updated in one unified interface.  Perhaps even adjust the dates with a slider with warnings/errors for conflicts.  Maybe even implement business rules for warnings/errors where there is a short/no in-port between cruises



X CCD_CCDP_DEEP_COPY_CMP_V has an error after running the test cases and v0.26 upgrade



Documentation consolidation:
_ Update the testing documentation to generalize it so the CCD and DVM packages can share the SOP (CCDP, CDVM in both the backend and the CRDMA tests - there is a lot of repetitive information)









X delete cruise test cases (automated error handling and processing test cases)

X update cruise leg test cases procedures (for identifying the pre and post update overlaps and executing the DVM accordingly)
 	X automated error handling and processing test cases (modify the existing ones and add more if necessary)


_ CRDMA tests for:
	_ CCD_DVM_PKG
	_ CCD_CRUISE_PKG



_ QC validation:
	_ No legs for a cruise
	_ time between legs over a certain number of days - unusually long or invalid (warning and error)




APEX Application

X DVM error annotation page
X DVM report page
X Cruise database data management page
X Cruise database report pages
	X cruise summary per year
	_ activity summary per cruise (list page with all cruise activities) - allow filtering by cruise
	_ allow searching by activity or data product

_ allow uploading/viewing of cruise instructions
_ Phase 2-3: spatial components, bounding box, search for research activities
_ bounding box -> range for individual sites
X ICAM
	All users have view-only access, specific people can edit
VPASS integration? (allocation) making the actual ship request - Nori will get me access to pull data
FINSS - https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/finss/si/siMain.jsp

X Bug - Load view/edit cruise page with invalid ID still allows edit/delete, etc.

Database Update:

_ Add Operational Information
	cruise - description, start port, end port, chief scientist, DOI - X View to get min/max dates to pull full cruise date range
		X cruise legs (e.g. HA1201 LEG III)
		X cruise leg region(s)
		X regions (store polygon, coordinates, etc.)
			_ islands (store polygon, coordinates, etc.)


	science party - name, role, affiliation
	X data sets - specific instances on specific cruises that references the data set types record
		X data set types (e.g. MOUSS video, CTD, water samples, coral belt, fish REA, etc.) - pull suitable categories from NCEI/NMFS
			X data sets collected (description, data set type, etc.), DOI, link to data set, link to documentation, link to NMFS metadata, POC info, etc. - link to application for accessing the data directly (e.g. Reefbox)
					X unique key constraint on data set type and cruise/cruise leg

				_ data products (e.g. biomass, richness, stereo video, coral cover, etc.) - Unique key constraint on data set and data product type
				_ data set products (date available, access url, etc.)



				_ cruise participants (phase 2)
					_ participant permissions
					_ participant checklist (requirements including how often/timeframe)
				_ cruise chief scientist


				X data set status (e.g. not collected, collected, processed, data products available, publicly accessible, archived)
	track pre- and post-cruise activities


	X create a function that can easily be used by a given external schema to match a given cruise leg alias so it can be associated with a given cruise leg alias record (CRUISE_PKG.LEG_ALIAS_TO_CRUISE_LEG_ID)



Questions:





_ tabular form for the SOD data administrator to update the requirements for all cruise participants (TB, conduct, etc.) - allows the updating of multiple participants' information concurrently


_ add/edit cruise page should also contain a tabular form with one record by default with the ability to add multiple cruise legs at the same time

_ should we go with a more generic "Mission" database and each mission would essentially be a cruise and there would be a type field that would have values like NOAA Cruise, Nearshore Mission?


_ auditing fields and history package on all operational data tables

X re-define views on CCD DB

X grant statements for CEN_CTD schema

Misc:
	I could give a piece of project to Kimberly, she will generate GIS layers and populate data model
	test best practices for data model
	shape files from cruise activities -> standardizing these data products
	point locations in DB for surveys
	how to define working areas?
	QC the region polygons for summary locations
	historic sites -> proximity (e.g. CTD stations)
		CTD historic sites could be indicated by text column for historic/not historic in the short term
	participant list is in phase 2
		Participants could be pulled from Peachy (non-confidential)
		Ship profile for people - non-public info: TB info, MAC address, food restrictions, IT security awareness
	associate data sets at the program level
	chief scientist and POC for data defined per cruise


External User/Group management (request if the CEN_CRUISE schema can be granted select access to a non-confidential view that has user (first, last, email) and group information (div/prog) that can be used to
	_ look into modifying the auth app views so that they use these tables for authentication/authorization so these don't need to be maintained separately.  Also need to assign admin privileges for specific SOD staff to be able to change anything in the DB


DVM QC Criteria:
X same ship cannot have concurrent cruises
X missing field values
X date criteria (start/end dates, etc.)
X regex for the cruise name to make sure that the cruise name (e.g. SE-15-01) is in the same federal fiscal year as the departure or end date


_ RSS feed functionality - subscribe to a cruise leg's data set or type of data set/stream for all updates or just when ready for download

_ utilize roles to grant the set of object permissions necessary to integrate the CCD into a given data set.  But this is problematic because roles are not enabled by default when executing PL/SQL code.  This needs more research




VPASS
	Logged in as a PI.  Could create a new ship request but couldn't see anything in the instructions to allow importing of ship requset data.
	Can pull reports and filter by FY and project name (e.g. PIFSC) but there is no option to download the approved ship requests only so they can be exported to the CCD.  You can also sort as well but the data for exporting cruise information is not readily accessible.
		Closest thing to being able to import a record seems to be copying an existing record in the system
	Can export ship time requests as a .xlsx
		VC Status seems to indicate if the project was approved or not (e.g. Certified by OU VC & Submitted to LO REP)
		X look at fields to see which should be added to the Cruise/Leg tables (some of the fields displayed in the interface are not populated in the .xlsx export - e.g.  start date, end date, Org Unit 1, Piggyback Notes)
			Some fields are shown on the searching interface and not in the Excel sheet (e.g. VC Status) and vice versa (e.g. staging port, staging day, staging day from, destaging port, destaging day, )




FINSS (planning system and reporting system)
	Logged in
	Survey Instrance Reports:
		Can filter the PIFSC cruises and then export as CSV file.  The CSV file does not contain the cruise dates.  This does contain valuable information like Categories, Gear, Vessels, days at sea, survey name, number of legs, etc.
	Survey Instance Records:
		Can filter the PIFSC cruises but there is no option to export the data.  Cannot export the data from the Survey instance search but it does contain information like Cruise dates in the Survey Cruises column.  But there is no way to readily export the data and import it into the CCD.  The cruise information is concatenated into a single field but this field could be parsed if it was available electronically.  Only other option is to copy and paste the dynamic HTML and then parse it using other means (e.g. programmatically but this is not recommended because this import process will need to change each time the interface changes).  Perhaps we could request a data dump for the PIFSC projects annually/periodically?
		Can export KML (look into this more)



	Data elements:
		Legs (called cruises in FINSS) - Leg Start/End date, days at sea (calculated), Platform Type (LOV), Vessel(LOV), Regional Ecosystem(LOV), Gear(LOV), Project Name in VPASS, Standard Survey Name (LOV),
		Cruise (called survey instance in FINSS) - Center (LOV - should always be PIFSC), FY, Survey Frequency (LOV), Survey URL, Survey Contact Email, Primary survey category (LOV), Secondary Survey Category (LOV), Target Species - ESA (LOV), Target Species - MMPA (LOV), Target Species - FSSI (LOV), Target Species - Other Species (LOV), Expected Species Categories (LOV), Comments


	SQL code to calculate the numer of days at sea (document this and define in CEN_TOOLS_PKG or CRUISE_PKG pkg)
		ex: select TO_DATE('20-JUL-19', 'DD-MON-YY') - TO_DATE('06-JUL-19', 'DD-MON-YY') + 1 from dual;

	Phase 2
		Maybe allow preferences to be defined (e.g. ESD CRCP cruises automatically select the coral species of interest and then they can modify to streamline and provide templates





Ask Nori the intent of the CCD with respect to FINSS and VPASS - there is no import functionality so not sure how we would use the CCD other than to import the information from the other NOAA systems to populate the CCD.

_ export calendar information (e.g. Google Calendar format, outlook, thunderbird, etc.)

X insert/update/delete cases for cruises in the testing documentation ->
	X ensure that the attributes are processed first in the processing order for deletions
		X delete cruise must remove all associated DVM error records before deleting the cruise

X (look into the settimeout version to ensure that the tabular form is loaded before populating it)
	X applied fix to P220 and P230 (5/5/20) using setTimeout
		X other species javascript for the copy cruise functionality is buggy (not consistent)
		X leg aliases javascript for the copy cruise leg functionality is buggy (not consistent) -> reloading page seems to resolve but this is problematic because people can save everything without realizing they need to define the leg aliases manually
	** _ maybe even check to see if it's loaded and then if not do another setTimeout loop until it executes and set a boolean or hard exit)

_ QA for valid email address

Gameplan (5/6/20):
	X test the JS code for the ajax other species and leg aliases request/population code to make sure it works.
		X Document the bug fix, document the fix,
	X implement the valid/invalid cruise indicators in the reports and summary pages, document the update,
	X update the documentation and commit the code, push the code, deploy the code to MIDD/MIDT
	X do we need to re-evaluate the validation - no (the only things that will change will not be functional, I've already tested the functionality on 220, 230 on 5/5/20)


_ create a view for returning all cruise information and related DVM issues
X QC Validation Issues Reports
	X implement default sorting for the QC validation issues
	X make sure the field order on all QC vaidation reports is the same

(7/1/20) Meeting Feedback:
Kyle - Not having much involvement in creation of cruises/cruise legs

Kristin - Suggestion: X (ended up labeling each of the charts in the interface) cruise summary cover page (description of what we are looking at)

Number of cruises and
(_ color coding - cruise summary page - color code the bars on the reports - or maybe a different way to show it)
(Easier on the eyes)


X Possible Bug: following deep copy did not report the overlap errors for the associated legs in the DVM


8/17/20 feedback from RR:

I just looked at the validation rules. They seem good to me!

I don't know how historical records may have been (cruises from long ago), but recent cruises are divided into legs that usually don't exceed 35 days.  (The maximum duration of our ships is 30-35 DAS before they need to reprovision.)  The fact you have it warning on legs longer than 30 days is good.

I assume in-ports are counted as part of an overall cruise length, but not as part of an individual leg.  (An entire cruise would consist of individual Legs (DAS) and in-ports, as applicable.)

What happens if work was done during an in-port? I know we had an ASRAMP or two where that happened.  It was definitely the exception and not the rule, but in thoseoccasions data was collected that was not during a DAS (cruise leg). Does that matter at all for this?

My response:

I'll leave the 30 days at sea warning in place for cruise legs.  The data system will currently not allow cruise legs to exceed 90 days at sea, should this be adjusted to 45 or is there a more reasonable number you could recommend?  Also, yes in-ports between legs are included as part of the overall cruise length.

That's a good point, I recommend that the in-port work be attributed to the previous leg in the event that there is work done in-port following the last leg of a cruise.  I have documented the pending cruise data system business rule for in-port work to ensure we are consistent moving forward.
