APEX Application

_ DVM error annotation page
_ DVM report page
_ Cruise database data management page
_ Cruise database report pages
	_ cruise summary per year
	_ activity summary per cruise (list page with all cruise activities) - allow filtering by cruise
	_ allow searching by activity or data product

_ allow uploading/viewing of cruise instructions
_ Phase 2-3: spatial components, bounding box, search for research activities
_ bounding box -> range for individual sites
_ LDAP
	All users have view-only access, specific people can edit
VPASS integration? (allocation) making the actual ship request - Nori will get me access to pull data


Database Update:

_ Add Operational Information
	cruise - description, start port, end port, chief scientist, DOI - X View to get min/max dates to pull full cruise date range 
		X cruise legs (e.g. HA1201 LEG III)
		X cruise leg region(s)
		X regions (store polygon, coordinates, etc.)
			_ islands (store polygon, coordinates, etc.)
			
		
	science party - name, role, affiliation
	X data sets - specific instances on specific cruises that references the data set types record
		X data set types (e.g. MOUSS video, CTD, water samples, coral belt, fish REA, etc.) - pull suitable categories from NCEI/NMFS
			X data sets collected (description, data set type, etc.), DOI, link to data set, link to documentation, link to NMFS metadata, POC info, etc. - link to application for accessing the data directly (e.g. Reefbox)
					X unique key constraint on data set type and cruise/cruise leg
					
				_ data products (e.g. biomass, richness, stereo video, coral cover, etc.) - Unique key constraint on data set and data product type
				_ data set products (date available, access url, etc.) 
				
				
				_ cruise participants
					_ participant permissions 
					_ participant checklist (requirements including how often/timeframe)
				_ cruise chief scientist
				
				
				X data set status (e.g. not collected, collected, processed, data products available, publicly accessible, archived)
	track pre- and post-cruise activities
	

	X create a function that can easily be used by a given external schema to match a given cruise leg alias so it can be associated with a given cruise leg alias record (CRUISE_PKG.LEG_ALIAS_TO_CRUISE_LEG_ID)

_ tabular form for the SOD data administrator to update the requirements for all cruise participants (TB, conduct, etc.) - allows the updating of multiple participants' information concurrently


_ auditing fields and history package on all operational data tables

X re-define views on CCD DB

X grant statements for CEN_CTD schema

Misc:
	I could give a piece of project to Kimberly, she will generate GIS layers and populate data model
	test best practices for data model
	shape files from cruise activities -> standardizing these data products
	point locations in DB for surveys
	how to define working areas?
	QC the region polygons for summary locations
	historic sites -> proximity (e.g. CTD stations)
		CTD historic sites could be indicated by text column for historic/not historic in the short term
	participant list is in phase 2
		Participants could be pulled from Peachy (non-confidential)
		Ship profile for people - non-public info: TB info, MAC address, food restrictions, IT security awareness
	associate data sets at the program level
	chief scientist and POC for data defined per cruise


External User/Group management (request if the CEN_CRUISE schema can be granted select access to a non-confidential view that has user (first, last, email) and group information (div/prog) that can be used to
	_ look into modifying the auth app views so that they use these tables for authentication/authorization so these don't need to be maintained separately.  Also need to assign admin privileges for specific SOD staff to be able to change anything in the DB


DVM QC Criteria:
_ same ship cannot have concurrent cruises
_ missing field values
_ date criteria (start/end dates, etc.)
_ regex for the cruise name to make sure that the cruise name (e.g. SE-15-01) is in the same federal fiscal year as the departure or end date


_ RSS feed functionality - subscribe to a cruise leg's data set or type of data set/stream for all updates or just when ready for download
